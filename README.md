# p910nd-rust

p910nd-rust is a reimplementation of [p910nd](https://github.com/kenyapcomau/p910nd) in Rust only for my learning purposes. It is not, and may never be, a replacement. It does not have the full set of features of the original.

Not implemented:

* Bidirectional copying
* One job mode
* Buffer management
